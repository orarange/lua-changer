Custom Redistribution-Prohibited License (CRP-1.0)

Copyright (c) [2025] [おららん]

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use
the Software for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to modify
the Software, subject to the following conditions:

1. Redistribution Prohibited
   - Redistribution of the Software, in whole or in part, in source code or
     binary/object form, whether modified or unmodified, is strictly
     prohibited without the prior written permission of the Copyright Holder.

2. Contributions and Modified Versions
   - If you modify the Software and wish to make such modifications available
     to others, you must submit those changes via a pull request to the
     project's official repository. The Copyright Holder (or project
     maintainers) may, at their sole discretion, choose to accept, merge,
     publish, or permit distribution of the contributed modifications.
   - Until and unless the Copyright Holder explicitly authorizes
     redistribution in writing, contributors and third parties must not
     redistribute modified versions.

3. Attribution
   - All copies of the Software used internally by the licensee must retain
     the above copyright notice and this permission notice in the source
     files (if the Software is used in source form). Since redistribution is
     prohibited by default, this attribution requirement applies to internal
     use and to any written communications referring to the Software.

4. No Warranty
   - THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
     EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES
     OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
     ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
     OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

5. Governing Law
   - This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
     laws of the jurisdiction of the Copyright Holder, without regard to its
     conflict of law provisions.

6. Contact
   - Requests for redistribution permission, or inquiries about licensing,
     should be directed to the repository owner (see project repository
     contact information).

Notes:
- This license expressly prohibits redistribution by third parties unless
  authorized by the copyright holder. It therefore does not qualify as an
  "open source" license under the Open Source Definition (OSI) and may limit
  how others can reuse the code.
- If you would prefer a standard license that permits redistribution, consider
  the MIT License or Apache License 2.0. If you want the project to require
  that modifications be contributed back but permit redistribution under the
  same terms, consider a copyleft license such as GPLv3 instead.

Replace [YEAR] and [COPYRIGHT HOLDER] with the appropriate values before
publishing this license file.
